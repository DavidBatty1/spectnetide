#Introduction 
This project implements a ZX Spectrum integrated development environment (IDE) that is integrated into Visual Studio 2017.
Originally, I intended this project to be just a demo project so that I can use it as illustration in my agile 
software design and testing courses, but it became a fun project.

At the moment it is entirely written in C#, but I plan to implement certain parts in C++ (somewhen in the future, for 
the sake of performance), and maybe in JavaScript, too.

Right now, the project implements a ZX Spectrum 48K Emulator (other Spectrum emulators will be added in the future), 
and probably is less mature than most of the ZX Spectrum emulators with longer past.

Nonetheless, this project has some unique features:

1. It is very well commented and harnessed with unit tests. I plan to add a lot of documentation that help you
understand how to design and develop such an emulator.
2. Although the project is only in alpha phase, it adds a number of useful features integrated into the VS 2017 IDE that 
you can develop for understanding ZX Spectrum applications and games, discover their code, and develop new ZX Spectrum apps. 
Let me list a you a few of them:
